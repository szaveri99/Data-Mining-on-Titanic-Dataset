# Titanic Dataset Machine Learning Prediction with Decision Tree and SVM

This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The project was developed using KNIME Analytics Platform, a powerful open-source data analytics, reporting, and integration platform.

## Overview

The Titanic dataset is a classic and popular dataset in the machine learning community. It contains information about the passengers on the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic. The dataset includes various attributes such as passenger class, age, sex, number of siblings or spouses aboard, and whether the passenger survived or not. The main objective of this project is to build predictive models that can accurately predict whether a passenger survived or not based on the given features.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values and prepare it for machine learning modeling. Features were selected and engineered to create meaningful input for the models.

- **Decision Tree Model**: A Decision Tree algorithm was employed to create a predictive model. Decision trees are intuitive and can be easily visualized, making them suitable for classification tasks like predicting survival on the Titanic.

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model**: An SVM model was implemented to provide a different approach to solving the prediction problem. SVMs are powerful for binary classification tasks and can capture complex decision boundaries.

- **KNIME Analytics Platform**: KNIME was used to design and execute the entire machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation. KNIME offers a user-friendly interface for constructing and visualizing machine learning workflows.

## Repository Contents

- **Dataset**: The Titanic dataset used for this project is available in the repository. It includes both the training and test datasets.

- **KNIME Workflow**: The KNIME workflow file is included, which outlines the entire process of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

- **Model Output**: The output of the Decision Tree and SVM models is provided, showing predictions on the test data and model evaluation metrics.
